**  body-parser dependency: parse json http request into server and makes sure 
it's running preperly

** change of script: 
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon ./index.js --exec babel-node -e js"

>> allows to run server and make sure that babel transpiles the code before it runs it


** Middleware
Functions that have access to the request and response object in an express application, 
and can run their code there. It can make changes to the request response objects, end end them,
can call another function in the stack using next, etc.

The middleware performs some specific function on the HTTP request or response at a 
specific stage in the HTTP pipeline before or after the user defined controller.
